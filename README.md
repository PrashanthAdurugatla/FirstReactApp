# A React Application (Robot Friends)

Project descriptionRobot friends is a React app which uses external resources such as users data (JSON placeholder API), robots pictures (Robohash API) to show its content and dynamically change its content with the search option.

This React application allows the user to search through a collection of "Robot-Friends" cards, each with a different name and character portrait attached to them. Once certain letters are typed into the input box, the collection of cards will reduce until only those that match the user's input remain.
